Self-taught since my youngest age, I love learning new things to improve my skills. Very curious by nature, I love the world of tech and experimenting with it, what I like most is the thought process while creating someting unique from a rough idea. With all my skills and knowledge. With about 4 years of experience and strong foundation in Python, Robotics,Automation, Web-Development and AR/VR.
